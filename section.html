            <h1>Project Hightlights</h1> 
                <p>The Project that found the most interesting so far was the first project in Skill Lab, which was designing a website that was something about The Hague.  </p> <br>
                
                <h3>Website</h3>
                <h4>Hompage</h4>
                <p>The website had to consist of three different pages. The first page that I created was the "Hompage". I inserted a picture of a beach house, so that the user already knows what kind of restaurent it is. The page also had a name of the restaurent and next to the name (left and right), the user could click to different pages, which were; About, Reservation, Menu and Contact us.</p>
