            <p>Last year during the Summer, I have decided to join an organisation, which was organised from my previous school. We travelled to South Africa for a couple of weeks and there we worked together with students, ranged from 5-20 years old. Our task was to teach them how to read and write in english and also to teach them different courses (Math and Biology). </p>

            <p>I have visted the same school in the last 12 years, meaning with this, I haven't changed to a different school during my education. I have completed my school in May 2018 and was rewarded with two diplomas. First my International Baccalaureate Diploma and then my American High School Dimploma.   </p>

            <p>This year in August 2018 I have started to do my second educational step, which means I have moved to The Netherlands to start studying User Experience Design in the city called Den Haag. Till now I'm very happy with my choices and hope that I will still carry on enjoying it in the future! </p>
