            <p>Last year during the Summer, I have decided to join an organisation, which was organised from my previous school. We travelled to South Africa for a couple of weeks and there we worked together with students, ranged from 5-20 years old. Our task was to teach them how to read and write in english and also to teach them different courses (Math and Biology). </p>
